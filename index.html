          <P>
            Whey protein is generally considered a group of soluble milk proteins that are separated from casein precipitation by adjusting the pH of milk to 4.6. Whey protein is a globular protein and typically consists of β-lactoglobulin (∼65%), α-lactalbumin (∼25%), bovine serum albumin (∼8%), and immunoglobulins, as well as some minor functional constituents, including lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase enzymes, and glycomacropeptide (de Wit, 1998). The soluble fraction after precipitation of casein from milk also contains lactose and fat. Based on the protein purity, whey protein solid can be categorized into several groups: whey powder, whey protein concentrate and isolate, and hydrolyzed whey protein concentrate and isolate, as shown in Table 9.1. Whey protein is well known for its high protein quality score because it contains the complete profile of essential amino acids, and is an especially rich source of leucine and cysteine, both of which are of particular interest for health benefits (Ha and Zemel, 2003). Because of its high portion of β-lactoglobulin, whey protein can form gels upon certain triggering conditions, including heating and salt addition (Foegeding et al., 2002). By modifying and understanding the unique microstructures and networks of whey protein gels, numerous applications have been recently developed (Ryan et al., 2013).
